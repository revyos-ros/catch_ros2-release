# An example launch file for running an integration test with catch_ros2.

# It runs an auxiliary test node (the node under test), and an integration
# test node (the node which performs the test).

launch:

# catch2_launch_file
# A required tag which will add a "result_file" argument for the launch file.
# This file will hold the results of the test.
# Description attribute of this tag is required for YAML launch file formatting.
- catch2_launch_file:
    description: 'An example Catch2 integration test launch file'

# Specific launch arguments can also be included at the user's discretion
- arg:
    name: 'test_duration'
    default: '2.0'
    description: 'Max length of test in seconds.'

# Auxiliary nodes can be run like normal to test integration between nodes
- node:
    pkg: 'catch_ros2'
    exec: 'integration_aux_node'

# catch2_integration_test_node
# a wrapper around node which passes the "result_file" argument to Catch2.
# There should only be one integration test node. This node will shutdown
# the entire launch file when it exits.
# Specific parameters and other arguments can also be passed, like the
# "test_duration" example below.
